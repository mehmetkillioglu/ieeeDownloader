Download IEEE Explore articles by using your institutional proxy server. 
My university's proxy limits web usage for another sites. It was painful to change proxy many times while doing some research.
So i made this application that can download articles on IEEE Xplore only by entering article number. To download, program requires
proxy server information. Program can save proxy settings and download location. So you don't have to enter it everytime.

Features
-Save settings like save location, proxy server's ip, port, username and password
-Change save location
-Download by one click
-It can save articles automatically by its title, number or a custom name
